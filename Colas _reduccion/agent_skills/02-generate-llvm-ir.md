# Skill: Generate LLVM IR and Initial Memory

## Purpose

Generate LLVM IR from the C source file, and run the program once to produce
the initial memory of the CGRA, `memoria.bin`.

## Required Tool

`clang-18`

## Commands

Run both from the program's folder, `src/<programa>/`:

```sh
clang-18 -S -emit-llvm <programa>.c -o <programa>.ll
clang-18 <programa>.c -o <programa>.out && ./<programa>.out
```

The first command produces the IR. The second compiles the source to a native
executable and runs it: its `inicializar_memoria()` creates and initializes the
arrays and saves them to `memoria.bin` in the current directory, with
`guardar_memoria()` from `src/memoria_cgra.h`.

## The Initial Memory

Like the memory of a processor, `memoria.bin` is binary: a flat array of
`float32` words preceded by a symbol table. Each symbol is one region (a bank):
its name, its first word, and its shape in `filas x columnas`. Matrices are
stored row by row. The exact layout is documented in `src/memoria_cgra.h`.

The region names are the bank names that the PE programs use in `LD`/`ST`
(skill 08). They come from the `RegionMemoria` table at the end of
`inicializar_memoria()`, not from the C variable names: in `matmul.c` the array
`c` is saved as `result`, and in `convolucion.c` `resultado` is saved as
`result`.

| Program | Regions in `memoria.bin` |
|---|---|
| `reduccion` | `a`, `b`, `c` (1 x `TAMANO_VECTOR`), `result` (1 x 1) |
| `matmul` | `a`, `b`, `result` (`TAMANO_MATRIZ` x `TAMANO_MATRIZ`) |
| `convolucion` | `imagen`, `kernel`, `result` (`TAMANO_SALIDA` x `TAMANO_SALIDA`) |

The CGRA never generates or rewrites this memory by itself; `run_cgra.py` only
loads it (and saves the results back with `--write-back`).

## Actions

1. Run the commands from `src/<programa>/`, unless the user specified another
   output directory.
2. Stop and report the compiler error if either compilation fails, or the
   program's error if it cannot write `memoria.bin`.
3. Check that the program printed `Memoria inicial guardada en memoria.bin` and
   record the regions it saved.
4. Delete `<programa>.out`; only `memoria.bin` is needed afterwards.
5. Use the generated `.ll` for all later stages.

## Outputs

```text
src/<programa>/<programa>.ll
src/<programa>/memoria.bin
```

## Notes

The generated IR is the canonical representation for graph generation and
scheduling. Do not hand-edit it before passing it to `opt-18`.

The IR also contains `inicializar_memoria()` and the helpers from
`memoria_cgra.h` (`guardar_memoria`, `escribir`). They prepare the data, they
are not work for the CGRA: only the loops of `main` are scheduled.
